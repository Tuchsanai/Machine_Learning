    "\n",
    "In this homework, you will learn how to apply K-Folds Cross Validation, normalization and de-normalization techniques on the King County House dataset. \n",
    "You will use the `pandas`, `scikit-learn` and `numpy` libraries for this homework.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset includes information about different houses in King County, such as the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, living area size (sqft), lot size (sqft), number of floors, and price.\n",
    "\n",
    "The steps you need to perform are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Load the dataset.\n",
    "2. Normalize the features using both Min-Max scaling and Standard scaling.\n",
    "3. De-normalize the data.\n",
    "4. Implement K-Folds Cross Validation.\n",
