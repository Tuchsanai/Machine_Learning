    "\n",
    "### Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this lab, you will:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Implement a basic Q\\&A function that prompts the OpenAI Chat API using a step-by-step chain-of-thought system message.\n",
    "2. Extend the module with a reflection step that analyzes the initial answer and improves the original question.\n",
    "3. Compare the original and improved questions and observe how refinement affects answer quality.\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "* Python 3.8+\n",
    "* OpenAI Python client library installed (`pip install openai`)\n",
    "* API key set in your environment (`export OPENAI_API_KEY=\"your_key\"`)\n",

    "   * What elements of question design led to a more informative answer?\n",

      " Of course! Here's a step-by-step approach to testing the robustness of a self-driving car's perception module under extreme weather conditions:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Define Extreme Weather Conditions**: First, clearly define what extreme weather conditions you want to test - this could include heavy rain, snow, fog, strong winds, etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Create Test Scenarios**: Develop a set of test scenarios that mimic these extreme weather conditions. For example, simulate heavy rain by using water sprays or simulate fog with smoke machines.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Test Data Collection**: Collect real-world data of these extreme weather conditions to use during testing. This can include images, videos, Lidar scans, and radar data.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Test in Controlled Environment**: Initially, conduct tests in a controlled environment such as a closed test track or a simulation environment where you can safely replicate extreme weather conditions.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Observe System Performance**: Monitor how the perception module of the self-driving car performs under each extreme weather scenario. Note any issues or limitations encountered.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Iterate and Improve**: Based on the results of the tests, iterate on the perception module's design and algorithms to improve its performance under extreme weather conditions.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Real-World Testing**: Once improvements are made, conduct real-world testing on public roads under controlled conditions to further validate the robustness of the perception module.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. **Continuous Testing**: Regularly test and validate the perception module under various extreme weather conditions to ensure consistent performance and reliability.\n",
