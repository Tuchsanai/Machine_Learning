    "# Lab: Understanding ReAct (🤖 Reason + ⚡ Act) with OpenAI\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome! In this lab, we'll explore the **ReAct** prompting technique. ReAct is a powerful pattern that enables Large Language Models (LLMs) to solve complex problems by combining reasoning and action steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is ReAct?\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of just asking an LLM for a final answer, we ask it to \"think out loud.\" It breaks down a problem into a sequence of steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Thought 🤔:** The model reasons about the problem and decides what to do next.\n",
    "2.  **Action ⚡:** The model chooses a tool or action to perform to gather information.\n",
    "3.  **Observation 👀:** The result of the action is given back to the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "This loop repeats until the model has enough information to give a final answer. It makes the model's process more transparent and often more accurate, especially for questions that require up-to-date information or calculations."

    "You've successfully guided an LLM to solve a complex problem by giving it tools and a reasoning framework. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Takeaways:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Transparency:** The `Thought` process shows you *how* the model is working, making it easier to debug and trust.\n",
    "2.  **Accuracy:** By using external tools (like search or a calculator), the model can access up-to-date information and perform precise calculations, overcoming its inherent limitations.\n",
    "3.  **Extensibility:** You can create any tool you want! Imagine giving the model tools to check your calendar, send an email, or query a database.\n",
    "\n",
    "**In the real world**, frameworks like **LangChain** and **LlamaIndex** automate this ReAct loop, making it much easier to build powerful, tool-augmented AI applications. However, understanding the fundamental `Thought -> Action -> Observation` cycle is the key to mastering them."
